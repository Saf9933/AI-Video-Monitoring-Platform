# Non-Functional Requirements & Monitoring

## Overview

The Student Safety Monitoring Platform requires comprehensive observability to maintain sub-3s p95 latency, 99.5%+ uptime during school hours, and strict compliance with privacy/fairness requirements. This monitoring strategy covers performance, reliability, security, and ML model quality across edge-to-cloud infrastructure serving 500-2000 concurrent classrooms.

Key focus areas: real-time safety detection performance, privacy compliance verification, algorithmic fairness monitoring, and proactive incident prevention through chaos engineering and synthetic monitoring.

## Alert Rules

| Alert | Condition | Threshold | Action | Escalation |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **High Alert Latency** | `p95_alert_latency > 3.5s` | 5 minutes | Page on-call engineer | Platform team → Engineering manager (30min) |
| **System Down** | `up == 0` | 1 minute | Critical page + auto-incident | Platform team → CTO (immediate) |
| **High Error Rate** | `error_rate > 5%` | 3 minutes | Page on-call + rollback trigger | Platform team → Product team (15min) |
| **Privacy Violation** | `privacy_violations > 0` | Immediate | Critical page + legal notification | Privacy officer + Legal (immediate) |
| **Model Accuracy Drop** | `model_f1_score < 0.80` | 30 minutes | ML team notification | ML engineer → AI/ML director (60min) |
| **Bias Threshold Exceeded** | `demographic_disparity > 10%` | Daily check | Fairness review + model retraining | ML team → Ethics board (24hr) |
| **Consent System Failure** | `consent_check_failures > 1%` | 5 minutes | Privacy team page + system disable | Privacy officer → DPO (15min) |
| **Edge Device Offline** | `edge_device_connectivity < 95%` | 10 minutes | Field operations notification | IT support → Facilities (60min) |

## Load & Chaos Testing Plan

**Load Testing Strategy**
- **Baseline testing**: Weekly automated tests simulating 40k concurrent events (80% of peak capacity)
- **Peak load simulation**: Monthly tests at 150% capacity to validate auto-scaling triggers
- **Stress testing**: Quarterly tests pushing to failure point to identify bottlenecks

**Chaos Engineering**
- **Weekly chaos**: Random pod termination (10% of non-critical services), network partition testing
- **Monthly resilience**: Database failover, single AZ outage simulation, ML model rollback scenarios  
- **Quarterly disaster recovery**: Full region outage, cross-region failover validation, data recovery testing
- **Blast radius limits**: Max 25% service impact, excluded during school hours, automatic abort on >5% error rate
