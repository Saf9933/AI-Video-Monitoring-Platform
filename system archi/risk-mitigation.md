## Bias & False Positive Controls

**Bias Detection & Prevention**
- **Demographic Parity Testing**: Weekly analysis ensuring <5% alert rate variance across racial/ethnic groups
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Monthly review of bias across multiple demographic dimensions
- **Cultural Competency Review**: Quarterly stakeholder meetings with diverse community representatives
- **Training Data Audits**: Ongoing assessment of training data representation and balance

**False Positive Mitigation**
- **Teacher Feedback Loop**: Immediate false positive reporting with model retraining integration
- **Confidence Calibration**: Platt scaling to ensure predicted probabilities match observed frequencies
- **Contextual Filtering**: Time-of-day, location, and activity-based alert suppression rules
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Mandatory teacher review before any disciplinary action or parent notification

**Alert Quality Assurance**
- **Target FPR**: <10% false positive rate measured across 30-day rolling windows
- **Severity Calibration**: Higher confidence thresholds for higher-severity alerts
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Multi-frame confirmation required for physical violence alerts
- **Cross-Modal Validation**: Require agreement from â‰¥2 modalities for critical alerts

## Incident Response Framework

**Priority Classification**
- **P0 (Critical)**: Privacy breach, system compromise, safety failure causing harm
- **P1 (High)**: Service outage, significant bias detection, consent system failure
- **P2 (Medium)**: Performance degradation, minor privacy violation, false positive spike
- **P3 (Low)**: Feature request, documentation update, non-critical bug
