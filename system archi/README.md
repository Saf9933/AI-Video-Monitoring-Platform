# Privacy-First K-12 Student Safety Monitoring Platform

## Executive Summary

The platform uses edge-first processing with hybrid cloud inference to detect student safety concerns (bullying, distress, altercations) from classroom A/V and LMS data within 3s p95 latency. Key trade-offs: **Privacy over accuracy** (on-device redaction for non-consented subjects reduces model performance but ensures FERPA/COPPA compliance), **Cost over latency** (GPU autoscaling saves 60-80% costs but adds cold-start delays), **Human oversight over automation** (no automated discipline, requiring teacher acknowledgment within 15 minutes). The architecture prioritizes explainable alerts with ≤5% demographic bias, immutable audit trails, and data minimization (30-day raw retention, 1-year derived features). Hybrid deployment balances edge privacy, cloud scale, and regulatory compliance across 500-2000 concurrent classrooms.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Safety Detection**: Multimodal AI analyzing video, audio, and text
- **Privacy-First Design**: On-device redaction for non-consented subjects
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: No automated discipline actions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: FERPA, COPPA, GDPR compliant
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP-based alert explanations
- **Bias Monitoring**: ≤5% demographic disparity tracking

## System Requirements

- **Latency**: p95 end-to-end ≤ 3s for live events
- **Scale**: 50–200 classrooms per school; 10+ schools; bursty traffic
- **Availability**: 99.5%+ school-hours availability
- **Security**: TLS 1.3+, AES-256 at rest, RBAC + SSO
- **Privacy**: Data minimization, retention limits, consent management

## Architecture Overview

The platform consists of:
- **Edge Layer**: Classroom devices (Jetson + cameras/mics)
- **School VPC**: Local aggregation and VPN connectivity
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Multi-region deployment with GPU inference
- **AI/ML Pipeline**: Multimodal models with late fusion
- **Human Workflows**: Teacher/counselor dashboards

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: AWS CLI, Terraform, Kubernetes CLI
2. **Infrastructure**: Deploy using `terraform apply` in `/infrastructure`
3. **Applications**: Deploy using Helm charts in `/k8s`
4. **Edge Devices**: Flash Jetson devices with `/edge/image`
5. **Monitoring**: Configure dashboards in `/monitoring`

## Cost Estimate

Annual operational cost: **$1.28M** for 1000 classrooms across 10+ schools
- Compute (GPU/CPU): $310K
- Storage (Hot/Warm/Cold): $23K
- Edge Hardware: $898K (one-time)
- Licenses & Monitoring: $28K

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Hybrid Edge-Cloud**: Balances privacy, latency, and cost
2. **Late Fusion ML**: Combines vision, audio, text with weighted ensemble
3. **Kafka Streaming**: Real-time event processing with replay capability
4. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime updates with automated rollback
5. **Multi-Region DR**: RTO <30min, RPO <5min for critical data
