**Data Collection & Consent**
- **Sources**: Consented classroom recordings, anonymized chat logs, simulated incident scenarios
- **Consent Management**: Granular opt-in for each modality, easy withdrawal process
- **Data Minimization**: 30-day raw data retention, feature-only long-term storage
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated scenarios to augment rare incident types (violence, medical emergencies)

**Labeling Process**
- **Primary Annotators**: Trained teachers and educational psychologists
- **Expert Review**: Child safety specialists for edge cases and policy violations  
- **Quality Control**: Triple annotation for critical incidents, Cohen's kappa ≥0.7 requirement
- **Active Learning**: Model uncertainty-based sampling for efficient annotation

## Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics**
- **Precision/Recall/F1**: Per incident type (bullying, violence, distress, medical emergency)
- **Area Under ROC**: Overall discriminative performance across all safety categories
- **Calibration Error**: Expected vs observed probability accuracy (target <5% ECE)

**Operational Metrics**
- **False Positive Rate**: <10% to maintain teacher trust (measured daily)
- **Alert Volume**: Target 2-5 alerts per classroom per week during peak activity
- **Response Time**: P95 inference latency <500ms per modality

**Fairness Metrics**
- **Demographic Parity**: Alert rates should not vary >5% across racial/ethnic groups
- **Equalized Odds**: True positive rates balanced across demographics within 5%
- **Individual Fairness**: Similar students receive similar risk scores (Lipschitz continuity)

## Fairness Testing & Audits
