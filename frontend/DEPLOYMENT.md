# 🚀 AI Safety Monitor - Deployment Guide

## Current Status: Ready for Public Access ✅

Your AI Safety Monitor app is fully configured and ready for deployment with both tunnel and stable hosting options.

## 🔗 Quick Public Access (Immediate)

### Development Server with Tunnel
```bash
# Start development server with public tunnel
npm run dev:share
```

This will:
- Start dev server on `http://localhost:5173` 
- Create tunnel at `https://ai-safety-monitor.loca.lt`
- Provide immediate public access for demos

### Production Preview with Public Access
```bash
# Build and serve production version
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The app builds to `dist/` and serves at `http://localhost:4173`

## 🌐 Stable Public Hosting (Vercel - Recommended)

### One-Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI (already done)
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Login to Vercel
vercel login

# 3. Deploy with production settings
vercel deploy --yes --prod --public
```

### Configuration Already Set ✅
- `vercel.json` configured for SPA routing
- Environment variables set for production
- Build optimizations enabled
- Cache headers configured

## 📱 App Features Ready for Public Access

### ✅ Dark Chinese-Themed UI
- Sidebar: "教室目录", "实时监控", "行为分析", "智能识别", "学生状态", "历史记录"
- KPI cards with Chinese metrics
- "月度统计概览" charts and analytics

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Professor Role** (PIN: 0000): Limited classroom access with privacy masking
- **Director Role** (PIN: 0303): Full access to all classrooms and unblurred media
- Real-time scope filtering and WebSocket integration

### ✅ Production-Ready Features
- Mock data for 1000+ classrooms
- Virtualized rendering for performance
- Chinese-first internationalization (zh-CN default)
- Dark theme with slate color palette
- WebSocket mocking for real-time updates

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables (Set in Vercel)
```
VITE_API_MODE=mock
VITE_APP_TITLE=学生安全监控平台
VITE_APP_VERSION=2.1.3
```

### SPA Routing Support
- All routes redirect to `/index.html` for client-side routing
- Deep links work correctly: `/classrooms`, `/monitoring`, etc.
- Browser refresh preserves current page

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Run `vercel login` to authenticate
- [ ] Deploy with `vercel deploy --yes --prod --public`
- [ ] Test main routes: `/`, `/classrooms`, `/monitoring`, `/analytics`
- [ ] Verify role switching with PINs (0000/0303)
- [ ] Check Chinese text displays correctly
- [ ] Confirm WebSocket mocking works on public URL

### Expected Behavior
1. **Homepage**: Dark dashboard with KPI cards and 月度统计概览
2. **Classrooms**: Virtualized list of 1000+ rooms with search/filter
3. **Role Menu**: Enhanced role selector with scope information
4. **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
5. **Performance**: Fast loading with optimized builds

## 🚨 Security Notes

- All data is mocked (no real student data)
- Environment variables are safe for public deployment
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Client-side only implementation

## 📞 Support

If deployment issues occur:
1. Check build logs: `npm run build`
2. Test locally: `npm run preview` 
3. Verify vercel.json configuration
4. Ensure all environment variables are set
